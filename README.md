# ProgrammerArtInjector
This is a library mod that allows other mods to inject resources into the "Programmer Art" resource pack.

Now you can make your textures fit in, even when people are using the classic textures!

## Usage
To include textures for programmer art, add a folder named `programmer_art` to your `resources` folder. In here, you can follow the normal `resources` folder structure.

Example:  
`resources/programmer_art/assets/modid/textures/block/some_block.png`

This mod will inject these resources into the "Programmer Art" resource pack.
